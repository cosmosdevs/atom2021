# The ATOM2021 initiative

*Modernizing Proof of Stake on the Cosmos Hub*

The goal of the ATOM2021 initiative is modernize 2016 era ideas about how Proof of Stake works for 2020 reality of Exchange Staking and nascent DeFi protocols.

* In 2021, derivatives of staked ATOMs must be issued by the Hub smart contract and available to DEfI projects
Derivatives of staked ATOMs do not exist today. We strongly believe that creating a mechanism for such derivatives is valuable to the participants of the Cosmos Hub ecosystem.  Presently, all ATOM holders are able to earn ATOM rewards as new blocks are being created.  Validators get compensated with more ATOMs for helping to secure the underlying network. Those who do not run a Validator are able to earn ATOMs by delegating to a Validator of their choice. However, there is no mechanism to speculate on future earnings of block rewards.  ATOM 2021 goal is to add that capability by creating ATOM Futures Token. That gives an opportunity for speculators to take long or short positions on the unearned portion of block rewards over some period of time in the future. These Futures Tokens can be traded and are available to be used in all DeFi projects that have Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) support.

* In 2021, staked ATOM holders must earn yield on custodial assets via Peggy

* In 2021, ATOMs must earn funds securing the consensus of other chains

The Cosmos Hub should reserve 250,000 ATOMs from the community pool to incentivize and reward teams that deliver the ATOM2021 initiative.
