# The ATOM2021 initiative

*Modernizing Proof of Stake on the Cosmos Hub*

The goal of the ATOM2021 initiative is modernize 2016 era ideas about how Proof of Stake works for 2020 reality of Exchange Staking and nascent DeFi protocols.

* In 2021, derivatives of staked ATOMs must be issued by the Hub smart contract and available to DEfI projects

* In 2021, staked ATOM holders must earn yield on custodial assets via Peggy

* In 2021, ATOMs must earn funds securing the consensus of other chains

The Cosmos Hub should reserve 250,000 ATOMs from the community pool to incentivize and reward teams that deliver the ATOM2021 initiative.
