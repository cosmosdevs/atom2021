# The ATOM2021 initiative

*Modernizing Proof of Stake on the Cosmos Hub*

The goal of the ATOM2021 initiative is modernize 2016 era ideas about how Proof of Stake works for 2020 reality of Exchange Staking and nascent DeFi protocols.

* In 2021, derivatives of staked ATOMs must be issued by the Hub smart contract and available to DEfI projects
Derivatives of staked ATOMs do not exist today. We strongly believe that creating a mechanism for such derivatives is valuable to the participants of the Cosmos Hub ecosystem. Presently, all ATOM holders are able to earn ATOM reward tokens that have the same characteristics and limitations of the underlying token. They are all staked and fully bonded for the purpose of securing the network. That means those tokens cannot be traded and are not available to be used in any other way.  ATOM 2021 goal is to change that by broadening the use cases of the reward tokens.  Instead of having an option to only stake the reward tokens back to the network and serving the same security purpose as the underlying ATOM, we are capturing their value in a separate Reward Token. Those are issued and stored independently in a smart contract. Even though their value is derived from ATOMs, Reward Tokens can have significantly broader use cases and are available to be used in all DeFi projects that have Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) support.

* In 2021, staked ATOM holders must earn yield on custodial assets via Peggy

* In 2021, ATOMs must earn funds securing the consensus of other chains

The Cosmos Hub should reserve 250,000 ATOMs from the community pool to incentivize and reward teams that deliver the ATOM2021 initiative.
