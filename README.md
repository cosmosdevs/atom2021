# The ATOM2021 initiative

*Modernizing Proof of Stake on the Cosmos Hub*

The goal of the ATOM2021 initiative is modernize 2016 era ideas about how Proof of Stake works for 2020 reality of Exchange Staking and nascent DeFi protocols.

* In 2021, derivatives of staked ATOMs must be issued by the Hub smart contract and available to DeFi projects
Derivatives of staked ATOMs do not exist today. We strongly believe that creating a mechanism for such derivatives is valuable to the participants of the Cosmos Hub ecosystem.  Presently, all ATOM stakers get compensated with more ATOMs for helping to secure the underlying network. However, ATOMs that earn rewards remain bonded and cannot participate in the DeFi ecosystem. ATOM2021 goal is to make DeFi projects available to ATOM stakers through ATOM Futures Token. That enables participants to take long or short positions on the unearned portion of block rewards over some period of time in the future. Since Futures Tokens are not bonded, they can be traded and are available to all DeFi projects that have [Inter-Blockchain Communication](https://cosmos.network/ibc) (IBC) support.

* In 2021, staked ATOM holders must earn yield on custodial assets via Peggy

* In 2021, ATOMs must earn funds securing the consensus of other chains

The Cosmos Hub should reserve 250,000 ATOMs from the community pool to incentivize and reward teams that deliver the ATOM2021 initiative.
